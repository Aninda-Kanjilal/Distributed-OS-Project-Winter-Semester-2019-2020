# Distributed-OS-Project-Winter-Semester-2019-2020
This repository contains the working code that we have implemented in our Distributed OS project which is "Implementing the Actor-Based Model in Concurrent and Distributed Systems".

In order to execute the code it is important to install the Thespian library in your system.
After successful installation of the Thespian library, kindly execute the fibactor.py file.
You will find it in Final Review\thespian-3.10.0\examples\fibtroupe\fibactor.py.
